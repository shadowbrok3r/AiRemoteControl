Okay, I need you to perform a sequence of actions on the desktop using your available tools. Please follow these steps: First, open the Notepad application. Use the `run_shell_command` tool with the command set to 'notepad' and empty arguments., Once you believe Notepad has opened (assume it takes focus for now), use the `keyboard_action` tool. Provide a `text` parameter containing a short, original sentence that you compose about the potential benefits of AI assistants., Immediately after typing the sentence, use the `capture_screen` tool to take a screenshot of the entire screen (call it without any parameters for a full capture)., Analyze the 'base64_data' provided in the result from `capture_screen`. Describe the main things visible on the screen, making sure to mention the Notepad window. Also, try to read back the sentence that should be visible inside the Notepad window based on the image content.

Please open the Notepad application. Once it is open, type the sentence "Testing the OpenAI Computer Use API." into the main text area. Then use the mouse to press and hold, then move the mouse, then release the mouse to notepad window around. if you cannot find the notepad window, check another one of the three screens.
